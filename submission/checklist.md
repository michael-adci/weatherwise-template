## ‚úÖ WeatherWise Submission Checklist

Use this checklist before submitting your assignment to ensure you've met **all** requirements.

### üìÅ GitHub Repository
- [ ] Repository is public or properly shared
- [ ] Contains your **Colab Notebook (.ipynb)** with a working Weather Advisor
- [ ] Includes a **README.md** explaining your approach to AI collaboration
- [ ] Includes **4 AI conversation `.txt` files** documenting your development process
- [ ] Includes a **300‚Äì400 word reflection** (`reflection.md` or similar)

---

### üß† AI Interaction Evidence
- [ ] 4 conversations included, each showing how you:
  - [ ] Explored the **WeatherWrapper**
  - [ ] Developed **natural language processing**
  - [ ] Improved the **user interface**
  - [ ] Refined AI-generated code through prompting

- [ ] 3 **before/after prompt examples** showing:
  - [ ] Initial AI code
  - [ ] Your follow-up prompt(s)
  - [ ] Improved code
  - [ ] Why your prompt was effective

- [ ] Demonstrated **at least 4 intentional prompting strategies**, such as:
  - [ ] Asking AI to explain its code
  - [ ] Challenging edge cases
  - [ ] Requesting structural improvements
  - [ ] Breaking down complex problems
  - [ ] Testing AI's knowledge of WeatherWrapper
  - [ ] Evaluating alternate parsing approaches

---

### üßæ Notebook Structure & Code
- [ ] Follows this structure in the notebook:
  - [ ] 1. Setup and Imports  
  - [ ] 2. Weather Data Functions  
  - [ ] 3. Question Processing Functions  
  - [ ] 4. User Interface  
  - [ ] 5. Main Program  
  - [ ] 6. Examples and Testing

- [ ] All **3 required functions** are implemented:
  - [ ] `get_weather_data(location, days=2)`
  - [ ] `parse_weather_question(question)`
  - [ ] `generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data)`

- [ ] Uses **pyinputplus** for menu interaction
- [ ] Uses **hands-on-ai.WeatherWrapper** for weather data

---

### üå§Ô∏è Functionality Testing
- [ ] Handles at least 5 example questions:
  - "Will it rain today?"
  - "Should I take an umbrella tomorrow?"
  - "Will it be cold this weekend?"
  - "Is it a good day for a picnic?"
  - "What should I wear today?"

- [ ] Answers are practical, relevant, and helpful

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection
- [ ] Discusses **most effective AI prompting strategies**
- [ ] Describes how you improved AI‚Äôs output
- [ ] Reflects on what you learned about AI collaboration

---

### üìÖ Final Check
- [ ] All files pushed to GitHub **before the deadline (16 May, 2025)**
- [ ] Submitted your **GitHub link to the LMS**
